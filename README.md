Code for master thesis of Jop Heuvelmans: Improving the efficiency and accuracy of online controlled experiments for hyperparameter optimization of recommendation systems using multi-armed bandits.

Main code is to be found in Simulations.py. One interesting example is included in the code. Other examples were excluded, because the Pickle files exceeded the upload limit (> 100 MB).
